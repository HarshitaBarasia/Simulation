# Simulation
This simulation is about the Revolution of the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars around the sun and it also tells about their distance from the sun and the relative speed of the planets. It can be used to visualize how planets revolve around the sun and orbital paths through their changing distance from the sun. I used python for creating this simulation.
